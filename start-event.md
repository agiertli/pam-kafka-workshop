# The Credit Card Raise Approval Project

In this use case we should handle the automation of a credit card limit raise approval process. Most card issuers allow customers to request an increased credit limit through their websites, mobile apps or over the phone. Letâ€™s consider we need to deliver this automation for a bank that wants to achieve a similar use case within an event-driven architecture.

The first task you have it to enable an existing process to react to events that are published in a specific topic. Whenever a new event is published, a new process instance should be created.

## Importing the project

Let's import the existing project so we can start implementing the eventing capabilities. 

1. Access business central, and import the following project: https://github.com/kmacedovarela/cc-limit-approval-app-step1
  ![]({% image_path bc-import-project.png %}){:width="600px"}

2. Let's check the existing project. Open the `cc-limit-raise-approval` process. Notice it is a traditional process. Processes like this can be started either via REST or JMS.
  ![]({% image_path bc-start-process.png %}){:width="600px"}

## Updating the process definition

3. To allow this process definition to be started with events, the first step is to change the start event to a *start message event*:
  ![]({% image_path bc-convert-start-event.png %}){:width="400px"}

4. Whenever a customer make a new request (independently of the channel used) an event should be published on the `new-requests` Kafka `topic`. With that, a new process instance should be started whenever a new event is published in this topic. Let's configure the *start message event*: 
  ![]({% image_path bc-start-message-config.png %}){:width="400px"}

  **Important:** we need to receive the data that is the event data. The KIE Server provides automatic marshalling to help us mapping the input directly to a _Data Object_ (a POJO). This project has an object named `LimitRaiseRequest.java` which we will use to receive the incoming data. 

5. On the properties panel of the _Start Message Event_, configure the input data:

  * Name: request
  * Data Type: `LimitRaiseRequest`
  * Target: request

  ![]({% image_path bc-start-msg-parameters.png %}){:width="400px"}

6. Save the process. Your process should now look like this:
  ![]({% image_path bc-process-step1.png %}){:width="400px"}

## Deploying the project

Now, let's deploy and test the project. 

1. On the breadcrumb, click on "cc-limit-approval-app-step1" to go back to the Project Explorer view.

2. Click on the "Deploy" button.

## Testing the project

1. Let's publish a new event in the `incoming-requests` topic using the Kafka producer CLI tool. Open a new tab in your terminal and access the `strimzi-all-in-one` project folder. 

  ~~~
  $ cd $PROJECTS_DIR/amq-examples/strimzi-all-in-one
  $ docker-compose exec kafka bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic incoming-requests --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
  ~~~

2. After that, Kafka producer will listen to new messages. You can send the following data, and press enter:

  ~~~
  {"data" : {"customerId": 1, "customerScore": 250, "requestedValue":1500}}
  ~~~

3. Back to the browser, open Business Central. On the top menu, go to **Menu -> Manage -> Process Instances**. 

4. On the left column, filter by "Completed" State. You should see as many instances as the number of events you published on Kafka:

  ![]({% image_path bc-lab-one-process-instances.png %}){:width="600px"}

5. Select a process instance, and next, select the tab `Diagram`. You should see something like: 

  ![]({% image_path bc-lab-one-completed-process-instance-diagram.png %}){:width="600px"}

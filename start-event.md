# The Credit Card Raise Approval Project

In this use case we should handle the automation of a credit card limit raise approval process. Most card issuers allow customers to request an increased credit limit through their websites, mobile apps or over the phone. Letâ€™s consider we need to deliver this automation for a bank that wants to achieve a similar use case within an event-driven architecture.

The first task you have it to enable an existing process to react to events that are published in a specific topic. Whenever a new event is published, a new process instance should be created.

## Importing the project

Let's import the existing project so we can start implementing the eventing capabilities. 

1. Access business central, and import the following project: https://github.com/kmacedovarela/cc-limit-approval-app-step1
  ![]({% image_path bc-import-project.png %}){:width="600px"}

2. Let's check the existing project. Open the `cc-limit-raise-approval` process. Notice it is a traditional process. Processes like this can be started either via REST or JMS.
  ![]({% image_path bc-start-process.png %}){:width="600px"}

3. To allow this process definition to be started with events, the first step is to change the start event to a *start message event*:
  ![]({% image_path bc-convert-start-event.png %}){:width="400px"}

4. Whenever a customer make a new request (independently of the channel used) an event should be published on the `new-requests` Kafka `topic`. With that, a new process instance should be started whenever a new event is published in this topic. Let's configure the *start message event*: 
  ![]({% image_path bc-start-message-config.png %}){:width="400px"}

  **Important:** we need to receive the data that is the event data. The KIE Server provides automatic marshalling to help us mapping the input directly to a _Data Object_ (a POJO). This project has an object named `LimitRaiseRequest.java` which we will use to receive the incoming data. 

5. On the properties panel of the _Start Message Event_, configure the input data:

  * Name: request
  * Data Type: `LimitRaiseRequest`
  * Target: request

  ![]({% image_path bc-start-msg-parameters.png %}){:width="400px"}

6. Save the process. Your process should now look like this:
  ![]({% image_path bc-process-step1.png %}){:width="400px"}
